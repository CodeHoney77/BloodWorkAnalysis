## README

MSBlood from Column 374 metabolites are non-polar 

For MS urine (cluster the data based of severity score) and  MS blood data (exertion happened D2 and and look at D4 after, look at delta change D1-D4):

Blood data is before and after 

Do patients respond differently to the exertion event. 

Clustering the data (on samples given to patients), how the metabolites change. 

Repo for Chronic Fatigue Data Analysis

D2 Before exertion D4 After Exertion 

Look for outliers, variance of metabolites. 

broad pattern of metabolites (median value)

Look for patterns in changes in metabolites over time. 

D4, D5 worst feeling for patient

D4, D5, D6, D7 can vary

D2, D8 could look more similar 

ManU Whitney test

Fault change instead of data, Difference in HC and ME (msblood)

MSUrine Metabolite variation (biggest change in metabolite number) Emphasis on D5, D6
